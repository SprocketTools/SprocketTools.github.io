			<h2>Update 21</h2>
			<h3>April 28th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>The entire website has received a makeover at this point.  The decal catalog can now be directly contributed to by anyone, and has also been reset in the process!  Don't worry, your old decals are fine...</h4>
			<h4>Community contests are also now displayed in the contests section, updated automatically by Sprocket Bot.  Make sure to check them out!</h4>
			<br />
			<h2>Update 20.2</h2>
			<h3>April 28th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>More UI updates!</h4>
			<br />
			<h2>Update 20.1</h2>
			<h3>April 27th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>Since adblockers can't get the concept of a font name "Century Gothic" including a space, I have updated the CSS to use "century-gothic" instead.</h4>
			<br />
			<h2>Update 20</h2>
			<h3>April 27th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>Tons of UI updates across the board.  Preparing for some hopeful future updates to the website...</h4>
			<h4>The powertrain calculator has received the most attention, featuring a much cleaner UI that should work better on PCs.  Thanks to Obi from the Sprocket Official discord for providing the new calculation formula!</h4>
			<br />
			<h2>Update 19</h2>
			<h3>October 27th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>The resources page is updated, and now explains how to fix broken custom battle screens.</h4>
			<br />
			<h2>Update 18.1</h2>
			<h3>October 17th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>More decals.</h4>
			<br />
			<h2>Update 18</h2>
			<h3>October 13th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>Alot of new decals have been added to several sections of the decal catalog, such as new textures and symbols.  Thanks again to everyone who contributed decals for this latest batch!</h4>
			<br />
			<h2>Update 17</h2>
			<h3>October 13th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>Well, it's been awhile!</h4>
			<h4>I've added a RGB decal generator to the decal repository!  Supporting nearly 6,000 unique colors, all you have to do is input the desired values and click on the colored box!</h4>
			<h4>New decals have also been added to the numbers and misc. section.  Thanks to everyone who has contributed decals so far!</h4>
			<h4>Some small changes were also made elsewhere.  The background is a bit brighter, and gearcalc now has slightly different formulas.</h4>
			<br />
			<h2>Update 16</h2>
			<h3>August 3rd, 2023</h3>
			<h4>Gear Calculator can now calculate a first gear based on your desired climbing angle!</h4>
			<h4>Gear Calculator now also uses a proper calculation formula, finally supporting up to 1600 transmission gears!  <i>Don't try to go above that.</i></h4>
			<h4>I might be able to add more customizability in the future, such as a custom R value.</h4>
			<h4>Updated the credits page to include contributions made to the decal catalog and gear calculator.</h4>
			<br />
			<h2>Update 15</h2>
			<h3>August 2nd, 2023</h3>
			<h4>A proper logo and home page have now been added.  No more sussy amogus for a logo...</h4>
			<h6><i>    ...A bit ironic, isn't it?</i></h6>
			<h4>Anyways: the Youtube Community Clash has now officially ended!  Thanks to everyone who joined in on our contest!</h4>
			<h4>To allow for other contests to make use of our tool, I have now converted the tank selector page to a standard selection page, but now with a "contest code."  Contest hosts can select any code phrase or ID to use for their contest, and require participatns to apply the code when selecting their tank.  This will permit variety between contests, while granting consistency and accuracy to the contest hosts themselves!</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 14</h2>
			<h3>August 1st, 2023</h3>
			<h2>Gear Calculator has been added!</h2>
			<h4>No more guessing what first and last gears you should use, this calculator does it all for you!  Simply input a few stats about your tank, and Gear Calculator will give you an optimized transmission setup for your tank that allows you reach the highest speed possible!</h4>
			<h4>Note: currently the calculator currently has issues with transmissions using more than 11 gears.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 13.1</h2>
			<h3>July 29th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>Some UI changes were made to make URLs look nicer, and now the navbar is a little more accurate.</h4>
			<h4>A memes section has been added to the decals catalog!</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 12</h2>
			<h3>July 29th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>The website has had quite alot of changes behind the scenes.  I'm gradually beginning the process of stripping Python out with the eventual goal of more Java everywhere, because who doesn't like Java?</h4>
			<h4>Some UI changes were made to remove bootstrapper code.  It might not look as pretty, but most pages will load faster now.  The exception is for the RNG pages, which I won't touch until after the contest ends.</h4>
			<h4>A decals catalog is now available!  This will expand with new decals over time - feel free to send some my way through Discord if you want to see them included!</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 11</h2>
			<h3>July 12th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>It was becoming noticeable that people had a hard time reading the navigation menu, which contained everything people were looking for, but they simply didn't see that it was there.  As a result, it is now much bigger.</h4>
			<h4>The description for the random tank generator has been changed.  Additionally, the outdated changelog page is no longer visible through the credits section.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 10</h2>
			<h3>July 8th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>A new rulesheet has been added!  Refer to this page for additional info about the contest.</h4>
			<h4>Armored Trains now allow for wheels to be file edited.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 9</h2>
			<h3>July 8th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>Finally outpaced Satisfactory in update numbers!</h4>
			<h3>There has been an update to the rules for Toyotas and IFVs</h3>
			<h4>Toyotas can now fall under the open-top classification, meaning you're able to ignore some space limitations.  IFVs are now also allowed to be wheeled, meaning their tracks can be file edited to be invisible.</h4>
			<h4>Remember that cheating is still not permitted.  Things such as turret boosters, hiding compartments inside the vehicle, and non-permitted file editing isn't allowed.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 8</h2>
			<h3>July 6th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>The Tank Idea Generator webpage will now stay permanently available, but without the YCC theming.  Check out the (slightly modified) new look!</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 7</h2>
			<h3>July 5th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>YCC Picker RNG has now been finalized!</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 6</h2>
			<h3>July 3th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>YCC Picker now tells you if you entered an incorrect ID.</h4>
			<h4>YCC Picker RNG now treats multi-cannons a bit differently, preventing heavy tanks with a 75mm and 76mm from being possible.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 5</h2>
			<h3>June 29th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>YCC Picker now has a loading status indicator, which should help prevent getting sent into a Sitcom unintentionally.</h4>
			<h4>Other tweaks and stuff have been added.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 4</h2>
			<h3>June 29th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>Definitely don't try to enter names into the YCC tank picker now.</h4>
			<h4>This definitely has nothing to do with the new error page that can appear.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 3</h2>
			<h3>June 28th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>New background, even better than before! (there is none anymore)</h4>
			<h4>Navigation bar no longer looks like the w3schools.com tutorial navigation bar.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 2</h2>
			<h3>June 28th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>Totally didn't add anything to the YCC Tank Picker, please don't try to find it.</h4>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2>Update 1</h2>
			<h3>June 28th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>This will essentially be considered the first time the website actually looks like a website... yay!!!</h4>
			<br />
			<h4>Anyways, the RNG has been changed for the RNG tester.</h4>
			<h4>- CDL, Medieval Siege Tower, and Walking Mechs are no longer possible.</h4>
			<h4>- Among Us vehicles now only have a 0.5% chance to be picked, down from 1%.</h4>
			<h4>- Siege Tank has been replaced with "Bunker Buster," capable of higher calibers.</h4>
			<br />
			<h4>The entire website has an updated look.  Feel free to give comments on the new style, and the awesome new background!</h4>
			<h4>A navbar has been added, allowing for new pages to be accessed more easily.</h4>
			<h4>Pages for guides, credits, changelog (which you might be reading right now), and more have been added.</h4>
