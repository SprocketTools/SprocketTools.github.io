          <h2>Update 21</h2>
          <h3>September 29thth, 2024</h3>
          <h4>Progress has began on updating the css sheet.</h4>
          <h4>The powertrain calcuator has been updated to V3, simplifying the layout and making it more accessible to phones.  It also received some styling touchups.  Feedback on these updates will be appreciated!</h4>
          <br>
          <h2>Update 21</h2>
          <h3>April 28th, 2024</h3>

          <h2>Update 20.1</h2>
          <h3>April 27th, 2024</h3>

          <br>
          <h2>Update 20</h2>
          <h3>April 27th, 2024</h3>
          <h4>Tons of UI updates across the board.  Preparing for some hopeful future updates to the website...</h4>
          <h4>The powertrain calculator has received the most attention, featuring a much cleaner UI that should work better on PCs.  Thanks to Obi from the Sprocket Official discord for providing the new calculation formula!</h4>
          <br>
          <h2>Update 19</h2>
          <h3>October 27th, 2023</h3>

          <h2>Update 17</h2>
          <h3>October 13th, 2023</h3>
          <h4>Well, it's been awhile!</h4>
          <h4>I've added a RGB decal generator to the decal repository!  Supporting nearly 6,000 unique colors, all you have to do is input the desired values and click on the colored box!</h4>
          <h4>New decals have also been added to the numbers and misc. section.  Thanks to everyone who has contributed decals so far!</h4>
          <h4>Some small changes were also made elsewhere.  The background is a bit brighter, and gearcalc now has slightly different formulas.</h4>
          <br>
          <h2>Update 16</h2>
          <h3>August 3rd, 2023</h3>
          <h4>Gear Calculator can now calculate a first gear based on your desired climbing angle!</h4>
          <h4>Gear Calculator now also uses a proper calculation formula, finally supporting up to 1600 transmission gears!
            <i>Don't try to go above that.</i></h4>
          <h4>I might be able to add more customizability in the future, such as a custom R value.</h4>
          <h4>Updated the credits page to include contributions made to the decal catalog and gear calculator.</h4>

          <h2>Update 15</h2>

          <h6><i>
              ...A bit ironic, isn't it?
            </i></h6>
          <h4>Anyways: the Youtube Community Clash has now officially ended!  Thanks to everyone who joined in on our contest!</h4>
          <h4>To allow for other contests to make use of our tool, I have now converted the tank selector page to a standard selection page, but now with a "contest code."  Contest hosts can select any code phrase or ID to use for their contest, and require participatns to apply the code when selecting their tank.  This will permit variety between contests, while granting consistency and accuracy to the contest hosts themselves!</h4>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Update 14</h2>
          <h3>August 1st, 2023</h3>
          <h2>Gear Calculator has been added!</h2>
          <h4>No more guessing what first and last gears you should use, this calculator does it all for you!  Simply input a few stats about your tank, and Gear Calculator will give you an optimized transmission setup for your tank that allows you reach the highest speed possible!</h4>
          <h4>Note: currently the calculator currently has issues with transmissions using more than 11 gears.</h4>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Update 13.1</h2>
          <h3>July 29th, 2023</h3>
          <h4>Some UI changes were made to make URLs look nicer, and now the navbar is a little more accurate.</h4>
          <h4>A memes section has been added to the decals catalog!</h4>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Update 12</h2>
          <h3>July 29th, 2023</h3>
          <h4>The website has had quite alot of changes behind the scenes.  I'm gradually beginning the process of stripping Python out with the eventual goal of more Java everywhere, because who doesn't like Java?</h4>
          <h4>Some UI changes were made to remove bootstrapper code.  It might not look as pretty, but most pages will load faster now.  The exception is for the RNG pages, which I won't touch until after the contest ends.</h4>
          <h4>A decals catalog is now available!  This will expand with new decals over time - feel free to send some my way through Discord if you want to see them included!</h4>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Update 11</h2>
          <h3>July 12th, 2023</h3>
          <h4>It was becoming noticeable that people had a hard time reading the navigation menu, which contained everything people were looking for, but they simply didn't see that it was there.  As a result, it is now much bigger.</h4>
          <h4>The description for the random tank generator has been changed.  Additionally, the outdated changelog page is no longer visible through the credits section.</h4>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Update 10</h2>
          <h3>July 8th, 2023</h3>

          <h2>Update 9</h2>
          <h3>July 8th, 2023</h3>
          <h4>Finally outpaced Satisfactory in update numbers!</h4>
          <h3>There has been an update to the rules for Toyotas and IFVs</h3>
          <h4>Toyotas can now fall under the open-top classification, meaning you're able to ignore some space limitations.  IFVs are now also allowed to be wheeled, meaning their tracks can be file edited to be invisible.</h4>
          <h4>Remember that cheating is still not permitted.  Things such as turret boosters, hiding compartments inside the vehicle, and non-permitted file editing isn't allowed.</h4>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Update 8</h2>
          <h3>July 6th, 2023</h3>

          <h4>YCC Picker now tells you if you entered an incorrect ID.</h4>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Update 5</h2>
          <h3>June 29th, 2023</h3>
          <h4>YCC Picker now has a loading status indicator, which should help prevent getting sent into a Sitcom unintentionally.</h4>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Update 4</h2>
          <h3>June 29th, 2023</h3>
          <h4>Definitely don't try to enter names into the YCC tank picker now.</h4>
          <h4>This definitely has nothing to do with the new error page that can appear.</h4>

          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Update 1</h2>
          <h3>June 28th, 2023</h3>
          <h4>This will essentially be considered the first time the website actually looks like a website... yay!!!</h4>
          <br>
