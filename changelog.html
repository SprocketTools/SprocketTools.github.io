			<h2>Update 1</h2>
			<h3>June 28th, 2023</h3>
			<h4>This will essentially be considered the first time the website actually looks like a website... yay!!!</h4>
			<br />
			<h4>Anyways, the RNG has been changed for the RNG tester.</h4>
			<h4>- CDL, Medieval Siege Tower, and Walking Mechs are no longer possible.</h4>
			<h4>- Among Us vehicles now only have a 0.5% chance to be picked, down from 1%.</h4>
			<h4>- Siege Tank has been replaced with "Bunker Buster," capable of higher calibers.</h4>
			<br />
			<h4>The entire website has an updated look.  Feel free to give comments on the new style, and the awesome new background!</h4>
			<h4>A navbar has been added, allowing for new pages to be accessed more easily.</h4>
			<h4>Pages for guides, credits, changelog (which you might be reading right now), and more have been added.</h4>
